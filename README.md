# Intel Sustainability Project
Thank you for visiting my page and checking out the project! Here you will find a data analytics project as guided by the Global Career Accelerator course. This project focuses on real data provided by Intel, and a hypothetical business decision on where the next Intel headquarters should be located. The project code can be found in the PDF file, along with visualizations and reasoning for where Intel should locate. The code is also completely in SQL, and the visualizations were done in Tableau.  

Once again, thank you for visiting!
